Consider your own interests and strengths when applying. You can apply to both positions and express your reasons over the interview to be considered for either positions. For example, if you are an AFM student but was an PR executive because you wanted to learn something new, but feel that you would do better as a Finance Director, feel free to apply to both PR and Finance. However, if you really did not enjoy being a PR executive, then take the risk and only apply to Finance Director.'

For example, if you apply to 4 positions solely for the fact that you want to be a Director in FC, then priority will be given to other candidates.'

We do erge you to consider travel and commitment times however, especially for choreographers. Choreographers have two rehearsals per scene per week which will take place on the University of Waterloo campus. Designers have rehearsals every other week that they must be present for, but must also make time to take measurements and make alterations. Please consider these factors when applying. For any questions or inquries, please contact the Artistic Director.'
