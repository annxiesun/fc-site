        question: 'Can I be a Director for two teams?',
        answer: 'Unfortunately, due to the amount of responsibilities and members you have to manage, it is not possible to be a Director for two separate teams. As a leader, we do not want your attention to be divided across two teams and instead would like you to focus on creating a strong and lasting bond with your Executives.'

For example, as a Events Director, as long as you make all the meetings and events (some will be weeknights) in person and constantly communicate with your team, it is doable if you are out of town for both terms. For most positions, it is difficult (but not impossible) for you to be out of town for the winter term as it is when activity is busiest for the club. If you know you will be travelling to make meetings, please communicate this to P-VP during your interview. If you are committed to taking the time to commute and be as present as possible, P-VP can consider accommodating you.'

      {
        question: 'What if I have co-op out of town?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Did I have to be an Executive of the team for the Director position I am applying to?',
        answer: 'Not necessarily. We have had Directors who have been a part of other teams but had the leadership qualities and transferable skills to earn the position. Consider your own interests and strengths when applying. You can apply to both positions and express your reasons over the interview to be considered for either positions. For example, if you are an AFM student but was an PR executive because you wanted to learn something new, but feel that you would do better as a Finance Director, feel free to apply to both PR and Finance. However, if you really did not enjoy being a PR executive, then take the risk and only apply to Finance Director.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I apply to more than one position?',
        answer: 'Yes, similar to the question above, there are situations where you can and should apply to more than one position. However, if you apply to multiple positions, be ready to back up your reasoning and choices at the interview. For example, if you apply to 4 positions solely for the fact that you want to be a Director in FC, then priority will be given to other candidates.'
