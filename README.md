## Intended Structure of Files:

FOLDER ← Name of component
 - index.js ← React component
 - content.js ← stores content like text & image sources
 - styles.js ← stores MUI styles

If there are more subfolders, they are components that belong within the parent component, & they should follow the same structure

## Notes:
- Landing.js is very unorganized
- Right now, /directors is the only role that has content
